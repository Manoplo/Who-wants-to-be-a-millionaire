# Who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire
Who wants to be a millionaire browser game with Node.js and socket.io

<h2>Basics:</h2> 

<p>This is a project made for 3rd trimester in first year´s Web Applicaction Development Upper Cicle (Spain). 
We had to set a multiplayer kinda game using socket.io and Nodejs technologies.</p>

My choice was a WWTBAM-kind of game which recolects everyone´s answer, sum them up and check if they match with the right answer to throw a new one. 

------------------

<h2>Tecnologies used</h2>
This is mainly done with Bootstrap 5 and ES6 Js for the server side and NodeJs+Express to set the server // Socket.io to set a simple, bidirectional front and back comunnication
that listens to specific events. 


------------------

<h2>Usage</h2>

Feel free to fork, make the project grow (a Battle Royale can be implemented, or a more elaborated intarface, ie) and share back. 
The game waits for 5 players to emit questions and countdown, and can be changed to whatever desired by editing index.js. 

Thanks for coming by :)
